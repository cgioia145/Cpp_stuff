# Cpp_stuff

This repository contains all of the code used to help me learn c++. The examples come from www.cplusplus.com and may be modified from the original code so I can see how changes in code affect the output files.

To compile an example, I'm using the following steps:
$ g++ <source_code>.cpp -o a.out
$ ./a.out

The first line compiles my c++ code to the output file a.out. The next line runs a.out.
